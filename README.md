# Patterns01 - Erik Gaustad

I changed the speed of the straight sphere to be a little faster than the rest.

I added a particle system behind each sphere to show its movement a little clearer.

I also changed the jitter motion to be a little more agressive and noticeable.

All should be in working order.  I couldn't decide on the best camera angle.

I used a planet from the asset store with a movement script that came with it so it rotates on it's own as well as with the movement of the mouse.
